# CS 4400 Phase IV Delivery Service Application

## Setup Instructions
To setup the application, you will first have to clone the repository. Next, open the file in a text editor and navigate to Delivery_service_all > delivery-service-back_end. Open up the MySQL Workbench and navigate to the Administration page (it will be left of Schemas). From there, you need to fill in the host, user, password, database name, and port. These should remain as default as provided, otherthan the password to your MySQL. Then, you will run npm install and node app.js and the backend will function as normal. Then, cd into Delivery_service_all > delivery-service and run npm install. Once done, run npm run dev andit will be live on localhost:3000.

## Technologies Used
The database, as can be expected, was done in sql. The backend communication with database was done in node.js through express, allowing us access to an API that communicates with the database. The frontend was done in react.js and next.js.
